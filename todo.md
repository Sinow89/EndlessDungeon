Thought process of milestones to start:
- Start with generating a room in the form of a square where you can "walk" around in with your character
- You should move in blockes like Rogue in a grid, one grid space at the time.
- ~~- Create controls for moving character WASD.~~
- Make in a Zelda 1 like dungeon. One Rectangle room, with maximum 4 entrence that connect to other rectangle rooms.
- Make so when walking to the "door/entrence" you travese to the next room.
- Make so you one startup create 8 diffrent rooms.
- Make so a random obejct spawns in one these rooms.
- ~~Make a bool on the tiles that is walkable, so you can define this way where the player can move and not.~~
